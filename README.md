# Facial-Emotion-Recognition-System

This project focuses on an **Emotion Detection System**, leveraging a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify facial expressions into seven categories: angry, disgust, fear, happy, neutral, sad, and surprise. The dataset was preprocessed to grayscale, resized to 48x48, and normalized for model compatibility. The model architecture consists of multiple convolutional layers, pooling layers, and dropout layers to efficiently extract features while preventing overfitting. The trained model is saved in reusable formats for deployment.

### Key Outcomes:
- **Real-World Application:** The system can be used for mental health monitoring, customer sentiment analysis, or human-computer interaction.
- **Performance Insight:** Although some misclassifications occur due to subtle differences in expressions, the model showcases advanced skills in deep learning and image processing.

This repository demonstrates expertise in **TensorFlow/Keras**, **data preprocessing**, and **model optimization**, making it a valuable addition to projects in AI and computer vision.
